        <h1>What Is the Difference Between <a href="“https://www.codingSCHOOL.com/catalog/language/html-css”">HTML and CSS?</a></h1>
        <h2>1. The main difference between HTML and CSS is that while HTML defines the structure of web pages, CSS is used to style those pages with a variety of different features. If we think of HTML code as the skeleton of a web page, CSS would be its skin</h2>

        <h2><mark>Other differences between <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.as”">HTML</a> and CSS include:</mark></h2>
        <h4><u>HTML consists of text contained within HTML tags</u>, while<a href=“https://www.w3schools.com/css/”> CSS</a> is made up of declaration blocks and selectors. Where <b>HTML</b> gives a web browser display information of various tags, 
            <u>CSS enhances that information to the browser</u> by adding styling to those HTML tags.
            <u>CSS can be used inside an HTML document</u>, but HTML cannot be used inside a CSS sheet.
            <u>CSS is used for presentation and visual effect</u> — to manipulate colors, fonts, and backgrounds, add visual style to sites, prepare images, specify margins and borders, and much more — while HTML is not.</h4>
